# PCAM_Autoencoder
AI-Driven Cancer Detection Using Deep Feature Clustering and Autoencoders using Deep Learning

https://github.com/basveeling/pcam

Dataset used: Patch-Camelyon (PCAM) dataset.

Classified that the image is cancerous or not using Autoencoder architecture including techniques such as image segmentation and processing, extraction using pre-trained Resnet18 CNN model, and applying this extraction feature to the autoencoder with fuzzy k-means, k- means, Expectation Maximization and T-SNE steps.
